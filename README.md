# HD-SystemShock
This is a WIP remake of the 1994 FPS System Shock, by Looking Glass Studios.  The gameplay mechanics are partially based on the original game and partially based on Hideous Destructor, a "realistic" Doom Mod.
Everything needed to run the mod is included here, except Hideous Destructor v4.7.1c, which can be found here: https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor/releases/tag/v4.7.1c
