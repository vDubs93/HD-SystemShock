# HD-SystemShock
This is a WIP remake of the 1994 FPS System Shock, by Looking Glass Studios.  The gameplay mechanics are partially based on the original game and partially based on Hideous Destructor, a "realistic" Doom Mod.
Everything needed to run the mod is included here, except Hideous Destructor, which can be found on the ZDoom Forums at https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=12973
